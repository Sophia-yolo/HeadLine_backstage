## 数词

#### 一、基数词

13-19结尾为teen【18只保留一个t，13、15特别记】
21-99之间非整数用连字符-【如：twenty-one】
和汉语一样，从大往小说，先千后百
三位划分法，从右往左，千分位制，所以英语中没有万、十万、千万、亿的概念

【100】---------------百hundred
【1,000】-------------千thousand
【1,000,000】---------百万million
【1,000,000,000】----十亿billion 

使用时注意：

（1）要表示21—99 的基数词，通常是先说“几十”，再说“几”，中 间加连字号。

如：twenty-eight(28), 

​	   thirty-three(33), 

​		ninety-six(96)等；

（2）对于101—999的基数词，则先说“几百”，后接and，再加末尾两位数(或末 位数)。

six hundred and twenty-three(623)

​         			 fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth

​         				nineteenth

几十  去y变e + th ：twentieth、thirtieth、fortieth

几十几  个位数变序数词 ：thirty-seventh、forty-eighth;

2. 表示“第几...”前面加the

*举例：*

- Today is the second of March.

  今天是三月二日

## 句子结构

1. 主+谓

 主语和谓语是句子最核心的成分，主语是发出或承受某个动作的主体，谓语是用来说明主语的动作、状态和特征的部分。谓语通常是述说性的，所以谓语动词是谓语中最重要的部分。

- She cried.

- Tom is dancing.

- The books are thrown away.


 

2. 主+谓+宾

 句子中，表示谓语动作对象的成分叫宾语，宾语是动作的承受者。英语中，及物动词后直接接宾语，不及物动词要加上介词再接宾语搭配。

- H loves you.

- Tina broke the rules.

- Tom agreed with my idea.


 

3. 主+谓+间宾+直宾

一些及物动词可以带两个宾语，一个指动作对象，叫间接宾语；一个指动作的直接承受者，叫直接宾语。间接宾语一般放在直接宾语的前面。如果放在其后，则间接宾语一般加介词to或for.

- He gave me a book.  =  He gave a book **to** me.(me为间接宾语，a book为直接宾语)

- Jim bought me a present.  =  Jim bought a present **for** me.(me为间接宾语，a present为直接宾语)


 

4. 主+谓+宾+宾语补足语

宾语补足语指在英语中有些及物动词，接了宾语意义仍不完整，还需要有一个其他的句子成分，来补充说明宾语的意义、状态等。

- I find learning English difficult.

- I saw the kite up and down.

- Tom make the girl cry.

- We consider him a good teacher.


 

4. 主+系+表

 表语在句子中用来说明主语的身份、性质、特征、状态、职业、内容、数据、方向或住所等、表语一般位于如be动词，taste, look, remain, appear等连系动词之后，二者共同构成谓语。

- Tom turned an engineer.

- This book looks new.

- The baby falls asleep.


 

英语句子可以归纳成五种基本句型及其扩大、组合、省略或倒装。

1. 简单句：He often reads English in the morning.

2. 并列句：I like English **but** I am not good at it.

3. 复合句：The foreign visitors took a lot of pictures, **when** they were at the Great Wall.

 

#### 二、如何增加句子成分

1. 定语

 修饰名词或代词的词、短语或句子，叫定语。英语的定语可以前置，也可以后置。

- The beautiful picture was drawn a famous artist.

- The apple trees were planted three years ago.

- Canada is a country with a lot of snow in winter.


 

2. 同位语

  一个名词(或其他形式)对另一个名词或代词进行解释或补充说明，这个名词(或其他形式)就是同位语。

- Yesterday I talked to my English teacher, Mr James.

- People, old and young, took to the streets to watch the parade.

- He is interested in sports, especially ball games.

- I have no idea that you were here.


 

3. 状态

 修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子的词、短语或从句，叫状语。状语咋句子中可以表示：时间、地点、目的、原因、结果、条件、让步、程度、方式、比较、方向以及伴随等情况。

- He can play the guitar well.

- Please read aloud!

- If it rains tomorrow**, we will stay at home**.

- But in order to help support their family**, they had to work for the bosses**.


 

#### 三、基本结构的长难句的两个解析方法：断开和简化。

断开一共有三种方法：

1、找*标点*。

2、找*连续词*。

3、*分析主谓。*

- If it has to hire a caregiver for every two children, it can’t really achieve any economics of scale on labor to save money when other expenses go up.

  如果必须为没两个孩子雇佣一个看护人，当其他费用增加时，它真的无法达到节省劳力的规模经济效益。

 

 

主谓一致

一、语法一致

1. 主语时单数/复数，谓语动词用单数/复数。

Tina is beautiful.

Butter has gone up in price.

 

补充知识点：the + 形容词

1) 表示一类人时，谓语动词用复数

- The young are mostly ambitious.

- The accused were aquitted of the charge.

   被告被宣告无罪。(指多人)

2) 表示抽象/个别概念时，谓语动词用单数。

-  The beautiful lives forever.

-  The accused was aquitted of the charge.

  被告被宣告无罪。(指多人)


 

2. 就远原则

  as well as、along with、together with、but、except.

  besides 连接，谓语动词单复数看前面 

- The student, as well as teachers, is interested in  the activity.

- A woman along with two children has come.

  


3. 就近原则

  there be句型，be->最近的主语

  There is a teacher and many students in our classroom.

  There are many students is our classroom.

 

  or、either or、neither nor、not only...but also...

  Either you or he is wrong.

  要不就是你，要不就是他错了。

4. the number of... + 谓语单数  ...的数目

 a number of... + 谓语单数  许多

The number of business failures has risen.

A number of the prisoners we saw are starving.

 

5. 动词不定式to do、动名词doing、从句 + 谓语单数

 To say something is usually easier than to do something.

 Watching films is my favorite pastime.

 What matters is not what you say, but what you do.

 

二、意义一致

1.集体名词class, family, government, group, team, population.

侧重整体+谓语动词单数

侧重集体中的成员 多名成员 + 谓语动词复数

Our family is in Beijing.

我们家在北京。

Our family all like playing soccer.

我们家(的人)都喜欢踢足球。

 

2. 分数/百分数/some、all、lots of、 halt、most、

the rest of + 名词 ->决定谓语动词单复数
